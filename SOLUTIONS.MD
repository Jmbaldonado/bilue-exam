- ✅ setup my third party, i visited provided third party however there is a time duration before activation of the 
  code thats why I opt to find another one, which turns out to be weather API 
- ✅ setup repository in this, i've used nestjs as my framework since this is my forte framework, and graphql for the 
  APIs to be built. Worth mentioning also that i use microservice and modularize approach here provided by clean architecture / onion architecture wherein the database, service (business) and resolvers/controllers (exposed) are separated with each other.

- ✅ uses also DTOs (Data Transfer Objects in terms of creating the input, manipulating the output and mapping out what the payload would look like in the frontend)
- ✅ first approach is to create a user wherein it will serve as my basic implementation of JWT for tokens and 
  authentication/authorization of my APIs (this is ideal and would be done if given more time.)
- ✅ had a hard time dealing with the third party since my connection had lost during the assessment.
- ✅ the solution was pretty straightforward. would have really loved to implement other feature and the third party 
  provided if my connection was not lost, I've also suffered power outage in our area thats why.
